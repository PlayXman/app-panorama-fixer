# XMP Panorama Fixer

Some photo camera apps (e.g. Samsung native camera app) do not set the correct metadata for panorama pictures, which causes them to be displayed as either regular or spherical pictures in Google Photos. This app fixes the metadata so the panorama pictures are displayed correctly.
